# RPGItems SweetRice Edition

[![Paper 1.17.1-1.20.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-1.17.1--1.20.4-blue)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-1.17.1--1.20.4-blue)

The NyaaCat RPGItems-reloaded plugin continued from [NyaaCat/RPGItems-reloaded](https://github.com/NyaaCat/RPGItems-reloaded).

Take it easy. **NO ANY** dependency plugin is needed this time.

Recently, I targeted to make RPGItems more powerful and easy to use.  
Original plugin is not only hard to learn and understand how to use, but also there are very few choices of powers, conditions and triggers.  
That's the problem I want to solve.

Do not use Spigot, use Paper please.

## Developer Support

```grovvy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'top.mrxiaom:rpgitems:3.12.2:all'
}

```
I uploaded it to central. It is easy to depend it. :P

New version is currently testing. The version will be `4.0.0` when we release it.

## Languages

Due to my works and study, I'm sorry that the `en_US` language file may no longer be supported.  
The old language file is available. But something new features are missing.  
If you want it, you can translate it from `zh_CN`.  
And also, PRs welcome.

## Accessible

We **will** publish the functional update and bug fixing. We **WON'T** publish the powers, triggers and conditions we made. They are packaged into an extension in our server.
